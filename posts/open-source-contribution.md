# Open Source Contribution

Hello everyone! In this blog, I'll guide you on how to contribute to open source projects. There are various open source projects available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## New Git Users

For starters, you can use [this repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/). Read the `README.md` file to understand how to contribute to the repository and learn the basic steps.

## My Experience

I am also a student with limited knowledge about software engineering. However, one thing I have heard consistently is that contributing to open source projects is always beneficial. I am currently looking for `good-first-issue` tags on GitHub to find projects where I can contribute.

## Google Summer of Code (GSOC)

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (**GSOC**) is a fantastic way to contribute to open source projects in a competitive manner. There are also some [helpful websites](https://www.gsocorganizations.dev/) that you can use to accelerate your progress.
